# Cornell Ranger - Trajectory Optimization

This is a repository for computing optimal trajectories for the Cornell Ranger, using GPOPS II. 

I'm still working on this code. More to follow soon. Ish.

## Entry-point scripts:

#### `Derive_*.m` 
Use the matlab symbolic toolbox to generate equations of motion in minimal coordinates.

### `TEST_*.m` 
Test scripts for either the dynamics or trajectory optimization functions.
