# Ranger Ankle Series Elastic Actuator

Here there be dragons!

This director contains incomplete code that I was using in an attempt to model the compliance in the transmission between Ranger's ankle motors and the feet. This turns out to be a complicated problem, for reasons too in-depth to explain here.

The basic structure here was to play around with SEA for a simple 1D model, and then progress up to the full model of Ranger.
