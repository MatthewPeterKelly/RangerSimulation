# Unit Testing for the Contact Solver
The code in this directory was used to perform various tests on the contact (constraint) solver that I use in the simulation of Ranger. The dynamics allow for the acceleration of the contact point to be specified. This code attempts to answer the question: What should the acceleration of the contact point be?
